class AccumulationKindValue(Enum):
    """
    :cvar VALUE_0: Not Applicable or implied by the unit of measure.
    :cvar VALUE_1: A value from a register which represents the bulk quantity of a commodity. This
        quantity is computed as the integral of the commodity usage rate. This value is typically used
        as the basis for the dial reading at the meter, and as a result, will roll over upon reaching a
        maximum dial value. Note 1: With the metering system, the roll-over behavior typically implies
        a roll-under behavior so that the value presented is always a positive value (e.g. unsigned
        integer or positive decimal.) However, when communicating data between enterprise applications
        a negative value might occur in a case such as net metering. Note 2: A BulkQuantity refers
        primarily to the dial reading and not the consumption over a specific period of time.
    :cvar VALUE_2: The sum of the previous billing period values and the present period value. Note:
        “ContinuousCumulative” is commonly used in conjunction with “demand.” The “ContinuousCumulative
        Demand” would be the cumulative sum of the previous billing period maximum demand values (as
        occurring with each demand reset) summed with the present period maximum demand value (which
        has yet to be reset.)
    :cvar VALUE_3: The sum of the previous billing period values. Note: “Cumulative” is commonly used
        in conjunction with “demand.” Each demand reset causes the maximum demand value for the present
        billing period (since the last demand reset) to accumulate as an accumulative total of all
        maximum demands. So instead of “zeroing” the demand register, a demand reset has the effect of
        adding the present maximum demand to this accumulating total.
    :cvar VALUE_4: The difference between the value at the end of the prescribed interval and the
        beginning of the interval. This is used for incremental interval data. Note: One common
        application would be for load profile data, another use might be to report the number of events
        within an interval (such as the number of equipment energizations within the specified period
        of time.)
    :cvar VALUE_6: As if a needle is swung out on the meter face to a value to indicate the current
        value. (Note: An “indicating” value is typically measured over hundreds of milliseconds or
        greater, or may imply a “pusher” mechanism to capture a value. Compare this to “instantaneous”
        which is measured over a shorter period of time.)
    :cvar VALUE_9: A form of accumulation which is selective with respect to time. Note : “Summation”
        could be considered a specialization of “Bulk Quantity” according to the rules of inheritance
        where “Summation” selectively accumulates pulses over a timing pattern, and “BulkQuantity”
        accumulates pulses all of the time.
    :cvar VALUE_10: A form of computation which introduces a time delay characteristic to the data
        value
    :cvar VALUE_12: Typically measured over the fastest period of time allowed by the definition of the
        metric (usually milliseconds or tens of milliseconds.) (Note: “Instantaneous” was moved to
        attribute #3 in 61968-9Ed2 from attribute #1 in 61968-9Ed1.)
    :cvar VALUE_13: When this description is applied to a metered value, it implies that the value is a
        time-independent cumulative quantity much a BulkQuantity, except that it latches upon the
        maximum value upon reaching that value. Any additional accumulation (positive or negative) is
        discarded until a reset occurs. Note: A LatchingQuantity may also occur in the downward
        direction – upon reaching a minimum value. The terms “maximum” or “minimum” will usually be
        included as an attribute when this type of accumulation behavior is present. When this
        description is applied to an encoded value (UOM= “Code”), it implies that the value has one or
        more bits which are latching. The condition that caused the bit to be set may have long since
        evaporated. In either case, the timestamp that accompanies the value may not coincide with the
        moment the value was initially set. In both cases a system will need to perform an operation to
        clear the latched value.
    :cvar VALUE_14: A time-independent cumulative quantity much a BulkQuantity or a LatchingQuantity,
        except that the accumulation stops at the maximum or minimum values. When the maximum is
        reached, any additional positive accumulation is discarded, but negative accumulation may be
        accepted (thus lowering the counter.) Likewise, when the negative bound is reached, any
        additional negative accumulation is discarded, but positive accumulation is accepted (thus
        increasing the counter.)

    :cvar VALUE_2: Typically used to describe that a power factor is lagging the reference value. Note
        1: When used to describe VA, “lagging” describes a form of measurement where reactive power is

        2: When used to describe power factor, the term “Lagging” implies that the PF is negative. The

        passed by the data producer, then the direction of flow enumeration zero (none) should be used

        This principle is analogous to the concept that “Reverse” energy is an implied negative value,

    This information represents a summary of power quality information typically required by customer
    facility energy management systems. It is not intended to satisfy the detailed requirements of
    power quality monitoring. All values are as defined by measurementProtocol during the period. The
    standards typically also give ranges of allowed values; the information attributes are the raw
    measurements, not the "yes/no" determination by the various standards. See referenced standards for
    definition, measurement protocol and period.

    :ivar flicker_plt: A measurement of long term Rapid Voltage Change in hundredths of a Volt.
        flickerPlt is derived from 2 hours of Pst values (12 values combined in cubic relationship).
    :ivar flicker_pst: flickerPst is a value measured over 10 minutes that characterizes the likelihood
        that the voltage fluctuations would result in perceptible light flicker. A value of 1.0 is
        designed to represent the level that 50% of people would perceive flicker in a 60 watt
        incandescent bulb. The value reported is represented as an integer in hundredths.

        0 means not applicable. Even though CPP is usually considered a specialized form of time of use

    :ivar interharmonic: [extension] Indication of a "harmonic" or "interharmonic" basis for the
        measurement. Value 0 in 'numerator' and 'denominator' means not applicable.
    :ivar measuring_period: [extension] Time attribute inherent or fundamental to the reading value (as
        opposed to 'macroPeriod' that supplies an "adjective" to describe aspects of a time period with
        regard to the measurement). It refers to the way the value was originally measured and not to
        the frequency at which it is reported or presented. For example, an hourly interval of
        consumption data would have value 'hourly' as an attribute. However in the case of an hourly
        sampled voltage value, the meterReadings schema would carry the 'hourly' interval size
        information. It is common for meters to report demand in a form that is measured over the
        course of a portion of an hour, while enterprise applications however commonly assume the
        demand (in kW or kVAr) normalized to 1 hour. The system that receives readings directly from
        the meter therefore must perform this transformation before publishing readings for use by the
        other enterprise systems. The scalar used is chosen based on the block size (not any sub-
        interval size).
    :ivar argument: [extension] Argument used to introduce numbers into the unit of measure description
        where they are needed (e.g., 4 where the measure needs an argument such as CEMI(n=4)). Most
        arguments used in practice however will be integers (i.e., 'denominator'=1). Value 0 in
        'numerator' and 'denominator' means not applicable.

    """
    Logical point on a network at which consumption or production is either
    physically measured (e.g., metered) or estimated (e.g., unmetered street
    lights).

    :ivar role_flags: Specifies the roles that this usage point has been assigned. Bit 1 - isMirror Bit
        2 - isPremisesAggregationPoint Bit 3 - isPEV Bit 4 - isDER Bit 5 - isRevenueQuality Bit 6 -
        isDC Bit 7-16 - Reserved
    :ivar service_category: Category of service provided to the customer.
    :ivar status: Specifies the current status of this usage point. Valid values include: 0 = off 1 =
        on
    :ivar service_delivery_point: [extension] Contains service delivery point information about the
        UsagePoint if it does represent the service delivery point.
    :ivar ami_billing_ready: [extension] Tracks the lifecycle of the metering installation at a usage
        point with respect to readiness for billing via advanced metering infrastructure reads.
    :ivar check_billing: [extension] True if as a result of an inspection or otherwise, there is a
        reason to suspect that a previous billing may have been performed with erroneous data. Value
        should be reset once this potential discrepancy has been resolved.
    :ivar connection_state: [extension] State of the usage point with respect to connection to the
        network.
    :ivar estimated_load: [extension] Estimated load.
    :ivar grounded: [extension] True if grounded.
    :ivar is_sdp: [extension] If true, this usage point is a service delivery point, i.e., a usage
        point where the ownership of the service changes hands.
    :ivar is_virtual: [extension] If true, this usage point is virtual, i.e., no physical location
        exists in the network where a meter could be located to collect the meter readings. For
        example, one may define a virtual usage point to serve as an aggregation of usage for all of a
        company's premises distributed widely across the distribution territory. Otherwise, the usage
        point is physical, i.e., there is a logical point in the network where a meter could be located
        to collect meter readings.
    :ivar minimal_usage_expected: [extension] If true, minimal or zero usage is expected at this usage
        point for situations such as premises vacancy, logical or physical disconnect. It is used for
        readings validation and estimation.
    :ivar nominal_service_voltage: [extension] Nominal service voltage.
    :ivar outage_region: [extension] Outage region in which this usage point is located.
    :ivar phase_code: [extension] Phase code. Number of wires and specific nominal phases can be
        deduced from enumeration literal values. For example, ABCN is three-phase, four-wire, s12n
        (splitSecondary12N) is single-phase, three-wire, and s1n and s2n are single-phase, two-wire.
    :ivar rated_current: [extension] Current flow that this usage point is configured to deliver.
    :ivar rated_power: [extension] Active power that this usage point is configured to deliver.
    :ivar read_cycle: [extension] Cycle day on which the meter for this usage point will normally be
        read.  Usually correlated with the billing cycle.
    :ivar read_route: [extension] Identifier of the route to which this usage point is assigned for
        purposes of meter reading. Typically used to configure hand held meter reading systems prior to
        collection of reads.
    :ivar service_delivery_remark: [extension] Remarks about this usage point, for example the reason
        for it being rated with a non-nominal priority.
    :ivar service_priority: [extension] Priority of service for this usage point. Note that usage
        points at the same service location can have different priorities.
    :ivar pnode_refs: [extension] A single electrical system Node or subset of Nodes where a physical
        injection or withdrawal of electricity is modeled and for which a Locational Marginal Price is
        calculated by the RTO/ISO and used for financial settlements.
    :ivar aggregate_node_refs: [extension] A sequence of references to AggregateNodes.
